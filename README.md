# AutoEncoders
The Ipynb file contains amd autoencoder implemented using Keras. The AutoEncoder takes 28*28 image and reduces it to a smaller size before reconstructung it. Below are the results

## 25% Reduction

### First I reduce the Image to 75% of it's original size, below were the results

#### Observation There is little lose and the reconstructed image closely resembles the original image


## 67% Reduction

### I go further and reduce the Image to 33% of it's original size, below were the results

#### Observation: Lose is a litter higher but the reconstructed image still closely resembles the original image with noticeable noise

## 92% Reduction

### Given the result so far, I go further and reduce the image to 8%

#### Observation: There's quite a bit of noise and lose but the reconstructed image still is somewhat close to the original image

## 98% Reduction

### For a final test, I reduce the image to just 2% of it's original size

#### Observation: There's  a lot of lose and noise but the number is still recognisable in the reconstructed Image
